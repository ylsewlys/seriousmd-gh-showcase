# STADVDB MCO1: Query Processing and Optimization in a Data Warehouse for SeriousMD

This project aims to integrate concepts in building a MySQL data warehouse, utilizing ETL tools, developing an OLAP application, and applying query processing and optimization strategies.
This repository contains the Jupyter notebooks used in cleaning and preprocessing the datasets, Apache NiFi script for data loading, and the technical report for further analysis.

## How to use the Jupyter Notebooks

Before running the Jupyter notebooks, it is assumed that the datasets_backup folder contains the original four csv datasets from SeriousMD:

1. appointments.csv
2. patients.csv
3. clinics.csv
4. doctors.csv

After running the Jupyter Notebooks, the cleaned and preprocessed datasets will be generated in the cleaned_datasets folder.
